This Arduino Sketch controls a NIXIE clock with 4 tubes. 
I used a plain ATMega168 microcontroller instead of an Arduino board for obvious reasons.
Here is a picture of the circuit board: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3873342/NIXIE/IMG_3210.jpg

I am using a DS1307 RTC chip to keep track of the time. 

Schematics will be made available as soon as I find some time.
